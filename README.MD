### Motivation
The visionary Apple genius Steve Jobs once remarked, “everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.” Now that software is consuming the world by automating all kinds of routine jobs, the basic knowledge of how lines of code create the digital world we explore every day is becoming a fundamental part of modern digital literacy.
Through this project, we will
*  develop a "kids'-version codeacademy"
  *  More visual feedback
  *  More modulization
  * More playable/sharable
* Design a set of highly spreadable course (business model)
