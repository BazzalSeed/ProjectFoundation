### Motivation
Quoting Steve Jobs, “I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.” Now that software is eating the world by automating all kinds of routine jobs, the basic knowledge of  how lines of code create the digital worlds we explore every day is becoming a fundamental digital literacy.
Through this project, we will
*  develope a kids-version codeacademy
  *  More visual feedback
  *  More modulization
  * More playable/sharable
* Design a set of highly spreadable course (business model)
